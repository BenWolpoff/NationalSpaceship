# AGES Development Process

## Issues
If you're looking for an overview of what we require of an issue for it to be
moved along the process, please check out the <a href="issue_requirements.md" title="Issue Requirements">Issue Requirements</a>
documentation, which should provide that insight. If you're looking for the
entire process, then this is the place you wan't to be.

### Labeling
While we move things through our development process we will be adding/removing
labels as we go through stories (issues). We will be utilizing the following
labels to help track things through the process:

- backlog
- in development
- ready for review

### Requirements
Each label has a requirement that must be met before it can be added to the
issue. Details around those are below.

#### backlog
It should have whatever information is required for the issue to exist. This
does not need to be complete, but it has to be enough for someone to understand
what is being asked.

#### ready for development
This is a fully written story with requirements. Once it is in here development
conversations have been had and acceptance criteria has been defined.

#### in development
This is being actively worked on.

#### ready for review (by instructor)
This is the point where code should be considered "done". The requirements for
code being considered "done" is as follows:

##### New Code
- Documentation on everything (fully commented)

### How Issues are Handled

- Log an issue that will be tied to a feature.
- Students are responsible for assigning the appropriate labels to the issue.
- Instructor will grade content when the 'ready for review' label has been assigned.
- All feature branches must be tied to an issue with requirements filled out.

## Git Branching
The following convention should be used for creating branches (all branches,
branch from master):

`(GitHub Issue Number)_(StudentInitials)_NameOfFeature`

eg. `13_NJ_InitialCommit`
