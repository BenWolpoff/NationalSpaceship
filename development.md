# AGES Development Process

## Issues
If you're looking for an overview of what we require of an issue for it to be
moved along the process, please check out the <a href="issue_requirements.md" title="Issue Requirements">Issue Requirements</a>
documentation, which should provide that insight. If you're looking for the
entire process, then this is the place you wan't to be.

### Requirements
Each label has a requirement that must be met before it can be added to the
issue. Details around those are below.

#### milestones
The instructor will manage a milestone for each student and will assign the correct 
milestone to each student's issue. Milestones for each student will help manage issues to stay associated with each project. Issue's must be formmated correctly.

#### ready for review (by instructor)
This is the point where code should be considered "done". The requirements for
code being considered "done" is as follows:

##### New Code
- Documentation on everything (fully commented)

### How Issues are Handled

- Log an issue that will be tied to a feature.
- Instructor will grade content when the 'ready for review' label has been assigned.
- All feature branches must be tied to an issue with requirements filled out.

## Git Branching
The following convention should be used for creating branches (all branches,
branch from master):

`(GitHub Issue Number)_(StudentInitials)_NameOfFeature`

eg. `13_NJ_InitialCommit`
